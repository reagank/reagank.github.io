      <p>Before I get into the electronics, I want to talk about some strange behavior from the Kinect. I’m using it as the eyes (and ears?) of the project. The depth sensing is awesome, but you can’t just plug it in to a computer - it’s not a standard USB plug. Adapters are easy to find, just a wall-wart to convert from 120VAC to 12VDC connected to an adapter for the Kinect plug. A short USB cord is connected to the adapter that carries the data to the Pi. Device drivers are now built-in to the Linux kernel, but you need instal additional software, like libfreenect, to take full advantage of the Kinect. There are a number of tutorials and StackOverflow questions that talk about connecting the Kinect to a Raspberry Pi or other Linux machine. In addition, the <a href="https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenKinect project</a> has very good documentation.</p>
<p>The instructions are pretty painless to follow, and the installation ran without any errors. The Kinect is supposed to appear as three different USB devices, a camera, an audio device, a motor, with the motor powered by 5V USB power, and the camera and audio powered by 12V from the adapter. Once libfreenect was installed, I plugged the adapter into the Kinect, plugged in the USB and ran a demo, only to be told the Kinect camera wasn’t connected. <code>lsus</code> showed only the motor was connected. I tried using it a second time with an iMac, but still couldn’t get it to work. I tested the Kinect on the Xbox and found it worked fine, so it looked like the problem was in the adapter. I was able to find a <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/thread/12665/l/xbox-kinect-pinout-for-those-looking-for-it?displayFullThread=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinout for the Kinect plug</a> Plugging it in and checking the pins that should carry 12V showed ~5V instead. </p>
<p>I’d always intended to cut the plug off of this to attach it to a 12V battery, so I cut the cord, which also let me test the output of the wall wart. The multimeter showed ~5V DC, which isn’t enough to power the camera and microphone. Connecting the Kinect directly to the battery resolved the issues, and I saw the motor, the camera, and the audio device and could run the demos. I doubt many other people would have this problem, but if the camera and audio device don’t appear when you attach your Kinect, check to make sure the power adapter is actually producing what it’s supposed to.</p>

      <p>Where I can, I want to use things I already have. That starts with the body of the robot - the main platform is made from a thick plastic 14” x 17” cutting board, with 1 1/4” x 2 1/4” slotted angle iron bolted to the bottom to act as a frame. I used a pair of 2 1/2” corner braces to connect perpendicular sides of the angle iron, and I fastened the cutting board to the top of the angle iron with 3/8” bolts.</p>
<img src="/2018/04/29/Body-and-Chassis/robot-chassis.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="The platform (i.e., cutting board) attached to the slotted angle iron frame">
<p>My plan is to attach the motor-gearbox assembly to the frame, although I haven’t worked out precisely how to do that yet. I’ll attach the casters in the front. but I want to place the motors and rear wheels first to see how tall it is. The platform carries the shiny bits of the robot, with the Kinect mounted at the front, a box with the electronic components mounted just behind it, and a battery centered at the back of the platform. The battery is secured to the platform using brackets and a bungee cord, and the Kinect and box are mounted to the platform with high-strength hook and loop fasteners.</p>
<p>Next up I’ll talk abut the electronics - what I’m using and how everything is connected.</p>

      <p>I’ve been building a robot for the last few weeks. It’s probably better to say that I’ve been planning for a few weeks and started building it this week. It’s not very complicated, and no one will mistake it for a professional piece of work, but it is starting to come together. I want to document some of the process here, and describe what I’m doing and why. This isn’t meant for a particular audience, and it may only be interesting to me, but I have stumbled across a few things while I’ve been starting, and it might be nice for that information to live in one place.</p>
<h3 id="What-do-you-mean-by-a-robot"><a href="#What-do-you-mean-by-a-robot" class="headerlink" title="What do you mean by a robot?"></a>What do you mean by a robot?</h3><p>I’m making a rover-style wheeled ground vehicle. I want it to be able to move autonomously (as much as possible), and I want to be able to drive it remotely. I’m using a Kinect to provide vision and depth sensing, power wheels motors to provide propulsion, and a Raspberry Pi 3 to control everything. I’ve built a chassis out of a piece of plastic and slotted angle iron, and I’m going to use casters as front wheels. I’ve been lax about taking pictures of my progress, but I’ll try to record my progress photographically from here forward.</p>
<h3 id="What-can-we-expect"><a href="#What-can-we-expect" class="headerlink" title="What can we expect?"></a>What can we expect?</h3><p>Sporadic posting, likely. I’ve never been good about keeping to a schedule, and don’t have a set time frame to finish this project. I’m interested in all sides of this - building and assembling the robot, wiring everything, and writing the software to operate it. I’ll try to cover all of those things here.</p>
